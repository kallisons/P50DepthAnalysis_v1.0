### P<sub>50</sub> Depth Analysis v1.0
-----------------------------  
 A primary mechanisms underlying hypoxia tolerance is blood-oxygen binding, which is sensitive to temperature. Blood-oxygen binding is measured as the oxygen pressure in the blood at which whole blood is 50% oxygenated, called P<sub>50</sub>. A low P<sub>50</sub> means that respiratory pigments in the blood of an organism equilibrate to 100% oxygenation at lower oxygen pressures, and the organism is more hypoxia tolerant. Temperature alters hypoxia tolerance by shifting the P<sub>50</sub> of organisms. The effect of temperature is measured as the heat of oxygenation (&Delta;H) which is the amount of heat energy released (negative &Delta;H) or absorbed (positive &Delta;H) when oxygen binds to respiratory pigments. Marine organisms swim between warmer, well-oxygenated waters near the surface of the ocean and colder, less-oxygenated waters in the deeper ocean.

This analysis assumes P<sub>50</sub> acclimation to temperatures at 10 m depth in the mixed layer.  P<sub>50</sub> in the water column can be determined relative to P<sub>50</sub> at 10 m depth using the Van't Hoff equation and oxygen pressure and temperature data. The P<sub>50</sub> depth is defined as the shallowest depth in the ocean where pO<sub>2</sub> = P<sub>50</sub>.  This code calculates P<sub>50</sub> depths for the global ocean.

#### Folders
---------------
**EnvironmentalData:** This folder contains the oxygen pressure and temperature data used to calculate the P<sub>50</sub> depth.  The folder also contains oxygen concentration and salinity data which are needed to determine the depth of the 60 &mu;mol kg<sup>-1</sup> hypoxia threshold.

**Graphs:**  This folder is where graphs generated by the Python code and R code are saved.

**PythonCode:**  This folder contains the Python code that is used to generate the geographic maps of P<sub>50</sub> depth.

**RCode:**  This folder contains the R code that is used to test and generate plots of the results.  The p50_deltaH_data.txt file has data from the literature for P<sub>50</sub> and &Delta;H measurements of marine species.

**Results:**  This folder contains the results that are generated by the shell scripts that run the NOAA Ferret software.

**ShellScripts:**  The shell scripts automate the calculation of P<sub>50</sub> depth for different physiological parameters using the NOAA Ferret software.

**TestFiles:**  Contains test files to verify the results were generated correctly.  

--------------------------
#### Environmental data
--------------------------
The data in NetCDF format was obtained from the [NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information World Ocean Atlas 2009](https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/WOA09/netcdf_data.html).  The oxygen data were corrected for bias using methods developed by [Bianchi et al. 2012](http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2011GB004209), and converted from oxygen concentration to oxygen pressure using equations from [Garcia and Gordon (1992)](http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1992.37.6.1307).

-------------------------------
#### Running the analysis code
-------------------------------
The analysis to calculate P<sub>50</sub> depth is run in NOAA Ferret using shell scripts in the ShellScripts folder. P<sub>50</sub> at 10 m depth and &Delta;H values to be analyzed can be added or changed at the top of the P50Depth_ABC.sh, P50Depth.sh, and P50Depth_geostats.sh files.  The output from the shell scripts will be put in the Results folder.  The commands assume that the current directory is the P50DepthAnalysis_v1.0 folder.  

Commands to run shell scripts:  

    sh ShellScripts/60umolkg_Depth/60umolkg_Depth.sh
    sh ShellScripts/P50/P50.sh
    sh ShellScripts/P50Depth_ABC/P50Depth_ABC.sh
    sh ShellScripts/P50Depth_ABC_Differences/P50Depth_ABC_Differences.sh

Command to run shell script (takes some time to run):

    sh ShellScripts/Geostats_P50Depth/P50Depth_geostats.sh

Command to run shell script (takes some time to run and produces 1.5 GB of results):  

    sh ShellScripts/P50Depth/P50Depth.sh

-----------------------------
#### Verifying the results
-----------------------------
Compare results generated using the commands above to a set of test files to make sure the results are the same. P50Depth.sh produces 1.5 GB of results so a set of test files is not included.  The analysis in P50Depth.sh is the same as the P50Depth_ABC.sh - the difference is that P50Depth.sh produces results for a wider range of P50 and &Delta;H parameters.  The commands assume that the current directory is the P50DepthAnalysis_v1.0 folder.

Commands to run comparison tests:

    Rscript RCode/RunTest_60umolkg_Depth.R
    Rscript RCode/RunTest_P50.R
    Rscript RCode/RunTest_P50Depth_ABC.R
    Rscript RCode/RunTest_P50Depth_geostats.R


-----------------------------
#### Graphing the results
-----------------------------
Plots of P<sub>50</sub> and P<sub>50</sub> depth are produced and saved in the Graphs folder.  The commands assume that the current directory is the P50DepthAnalysis_v1.0 folder.

Commands to graph the results:

    Rscript RCode/Analysis_P50Depth_point.R
    Rscript RCode/Analysis_P50Depth_transect.R
    python PythonCode/P50Depth_ABC_Maps.py
    python PythonCode/P50Depth_ABC_Differences_Maps.py
    Rscript RCode/Analysis_P50Depth_parameters.R
